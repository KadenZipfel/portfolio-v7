            I am a front-end developer specializing in React, with 
            experience building full-stack applications and marketing 
            pages. With my background in design, I have an eye for 
            detail that allows me to continuously perfect my work.

            My passion for open source software has given me experience 
            in a large array of diverse programming environments, whilst 
            greatly refining my knowledge of Git. By working on a large 
            variety of projects, I have become comfortable efficiently 
            learning new programming frameworks and paradigms.

            Along my ongoing search for knowledge, I have learned the 
            importance of several programming paradigms including 
            functional vs. object oriented programming and error 
            driven vs. test driven development. I have also built 
            confidence in several languages and frameworks such as: 
            React, Typescript, Node, Express and Sass.

            I am currently in search of a full-time position where I 
            have the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment 
            in which I can continuously grow as both a developer and a person.
